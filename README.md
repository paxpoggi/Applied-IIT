# Consciousness-Calulator

This repository stores a variety of code associated with calculating Φ, the variable of consciousness in integrated information theory of Consciousness (IIT). It relies heavily on the PyPhi toolbox.[^1]:Mayner WGP, Marshall W, Albantakis L, Findlay G, Marchman R, Tononi G. (2018). PyPhi: A toolbox for integrated information theory.PLOS Computational Biology 14(7): e1006343.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006343
The following scripts calculate Φ using both spiking data as well as local field potentials (LFPs).
