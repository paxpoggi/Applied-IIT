# LFP, CSD, Spiking Phi Master Scripts

## LFP and CSD Analysis

The following scripts calculate $\Phi$ for LFP and CSD data. The calculations are performed on 50s intervals for each of the six stimulus types and on 6 brain areas across the visual hierarchy. The main finding is that $\Phi$ scales with stimulus richness across the visual hierarchy.

## Spiking analysis

The spiking analysis calculates $\Phi$ time series data for groups of three neurons. It is still under development.
